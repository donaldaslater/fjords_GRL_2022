*Geophysical Research Letters*, 2022

## Code
It contains the following code files (all MATLAB):

*process_calvingfronts.m* - defines calving fronts  
*process_fjords.m* - defines fjords  
*process_runoff.m* - gets subglacial runoff from [Mankoff et al. 2020](https://essd.copernicus.org/articles/12/2811/2020/)  
*process_glaciers.m* - defines glaciers  
*link_data.m* - brings datasets together (calving fronts, fjords, glaciers, CTDs)  
*process_plume.m* - runs plume model for all glaciers  
*process_seasonality.m* - investigates plume seasonality  

*rho.m* - plume model equation of state  
*run_plume.m* - plume model top level code  

*makeplots.m* - makes plots used in the manuscript  
*maketable.m* - makes the csv data table in the SI  
*fjord_plots.m* - makes fjord-by-fjord map plots in the SI  

*polarstereo_inv.m* - converts polar stereographic to lat/lon  
*latlon2utm.m* - converts lat/lon to polar stereographic  
*customlegend.m* - simple code for custom plot legend  
*errplot.m* - a simple custom plotting function called in makeplots.m  
*plotbox.m* - another simple custom plotting function called in makeplots.m  
*saveplot.m* - function for saving plots as png  
*saveplot_pdf.m* - function for saving plots as pdf

## Required data
It contains the following data files (all .mat):

*ice_ocean_sectors.mat* - sector polygons derived in [Slater et al. 2019](https://tc.copernicus.org/articles/13/2489/2019/)  
*all_OMG_CTD_from_csv_ver_1.3.mat* - [OMG CTD data](https://omg.jpl.nasa.gov/portal/data/OMGEV-AXCTD)  
*carroll_2016_CTDs.mat* - CTD data from [Carroll et al. 2016](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/2016GL070170)  
*mortensen_meire.mat* - CTD data from [Mortensen & Meire 2020](https://doi.pangaea.de/10.1594/PANGAEA.921991)  
*sarqardleq.mat* - CTD data from [Straneo 2019](https://arcticdata.io/catalog/view/doi%3A10.18739%2FA2B853H78)

The following files are used but are not included in this directory:

[BedMachine Greenland v4](https://nsidc.org/data/IDBMG4)  
[Plotting colormaps](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/28943-color-palette-tables-cpt-for-matlab)

## Created outputs
The code will create the following outputs

*calvingfronts.mat* - these are the calving fronts created by process_calvingfronts.m  
*fjords.mat* - this is the fjord mask created by process_fjords.m  
*runoff.mat* - subglacial runoff resulting from process_runoff.m  
*glaciers.mat* - this is the glaciers structure created by process_glaciers.m  
*twglaciers.mat* - this is the main output, containing the 136 tidewater glaciers and their associated plume properties etc

## Running order

To reproduce the results, run the scripts in the order
*process_calvingfronts.m*  
*process_fjords.m*  
*process_runoff.m*  
*process_glaciers.m*  
*link_data.m*  
*process_plume.m*  
*process_seasonality.m*  

To make the plots in the paper and SI, run *makeplots.m* and/or *fjord_plots.m*. To make the data table run *maketable.m*.
